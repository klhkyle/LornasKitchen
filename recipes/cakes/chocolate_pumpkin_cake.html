        <h2>Frosting:</h2>

          <li>6 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups icing sugar</li>
          <li>2 1/4 teaspoons cocoa powder</li>

          <li>3/4 cup icing sugar</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon orange food coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Glaze:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons syrup</li>
          <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 375Â°F</li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and yolk one at a time.</li>
          <li>In a separate mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
          <li>In another mixing bowl, stir together the pumpkin puree, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>Add the flour mixture and the pumpkin mixture to the creamed mixture in thirds, alternating between the two and mixing well after each addition.</li>
          <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
          <li>Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
          <li>While the cake is cooling, make the frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and vanilla until smooth. In a separate mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture, along with the orange food coloring.</li>
          <li>Once the cake has cooled, spread the frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Chill the cake in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>While the cake is chilling, make the glaze. Place the chocolate, butter, and syrup in a heat-safe bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate mixture and let it stand for 3 minutes. Gently stir the mixture with a whisk until it is smooth. Let the glaze stand until it thickens.</li>
          <li>Pour the glaze over the center of the frosted cake and smooth it out to the edges, allowing it to drip down the sides of the cake. Chill the cake in the fridge until the glaze is set.</li>
          <li>Serve the Chocolate Pumpkin Cake chilled or at room temperature, as desired. Enjoy!</li>
