        <h1>Lemon Angel Pie</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 large egg whites at room temperature</li>
          <li>¼ t cream of tartar</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
          <li>1 C granulated sugar</li>
          <li>¾ C heavy (whipping) cream</li>
          <li>1 ½ C lemon curd</li>
          <li>2 C mixed fresh ripe berries</li>
          <li>icing sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 225. Trace a 9-inch circle on a sheet of parchment paper. Place the paper on a baking sheet.</li>
          <br>
          <li>2. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until foamy. Increase the speed to medium-high, add the cream of tartar and the salt, and beat just until the egg whites form soft peaks. Add the granulated sugar about 2 T at a time, and continue beating just until stiff peaks formed.</li>
          <br>
          <li>3.  Spoon the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.  Starting at the outside edge of the circle traced on the parchment paper, pipe the meringue into a spiral to fill the circle.  Holding the pastry bag upright and starting at the outer edge of the meringue, pipe 1 tier of rosettes along the edge to make a rim; then pipe a second tier of rosettes on the shoulders of the first tier.  Or, if you don’t have a pastry bag, spoon the meringue in a circle, scooping the sides upward to form a rim.</li>
          <br>
          <li>4.	Bake for 1 hour, or until the meringue is dry to the touch.  Turn off the oven and leave the meringue in the oven for 2 hours.  Peel off the paper.  Store the meringue, tightly wrapped, if not using immediately.</li>
          <br>
          <li>5.	Just before serving, beat the cream with an electric mixer on high speed in a large bowl just until it forms stiff peaks.  Beat in the lemon Curd just until combined well.  Spoon the lemon filling into the meringue shell, arrange the berries on top, and lightly sift confectioners’ sugar over the berries.  Serve immediately.</li>
